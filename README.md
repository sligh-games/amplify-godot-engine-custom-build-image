A production-ready Docker image solution that enables seamless CI/CD workflows for Godot Engine game development on AWS Amplify. This project provides custom build images that allow you to automatically build, test, and export Godot games for all supported platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Web, Android, and iOS) directly within your AWS infrastructure.

### Key Features

- **Multi-platform Support**: Build and export for all Godot-supported platforms in one workflow
- **AWS Integration**: Pre-configured with AWS CLI and optimized for Amplify deployments
- **Version Flexibility**: Multiple Godot versions available (4.1 through 4.4.1)
- **Production Ready**: Used by game studios to streamline their deployment pipelines
- **Extensible**: Built on the established Godot CI image with additional AWS-specific tooling
